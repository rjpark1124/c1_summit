# Capital One Summit Program Web App
My web app for the Capital One Summit program.

## About
This simple web app was created using Flask on python. A Bootstrap template was used for this project. The features include a quick search from the homepage and using a more advanced/refined search from the search tab. You can click on the images from the results to see a more detailed view of the image as well as a description. The detailed view also links users to the original image from NASA in case the user needs access to a higher resolution image. 

## Live Deployed App
The web app was deployed on Heroku. Check it out here!

## Additional Credits

The images shown in the web app do not belong to me and are taken directly from the NASA Image API: https://images.nasa.gov/
